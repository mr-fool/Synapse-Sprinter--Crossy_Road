# Synapse-Sprinter-Crossy Road

# Real-Time Adaptive EMG Gaming Framework

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the practical implementation of the EMG gaming system described in our IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing paper.

## Repository Scope & Limitations
### What This Code Includes
- Real-time EMG signal acquisition from Arduino
- Basic signal processing pipeline (filtering, RMS windowing)  
- Game control interface
- Proof-of-concept demonstration

### What This Code Does NOT Include
- Theoretical ROC analysis implementations
- PI convergence proofs
- Monte Carlo simulation scripts
- Ninapro DB1 validation routines

**Note**: Mathematical analyses (ROC bounds, detection theory, PI convergence proofs) are provided analytically in the research paper and do not require computational verification.
## Inspiration
This project finds its inspiration in the challenges faced by individuals affected by Muscular Dystrophy. It aims to bring joy and assist in the rehabilitation of those with muscular impairments by integrating hardware into gaming systems. Muscular Dystrophy, a group of diseases causing progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass, serves as a poignant motivation to create an inclusive and enjoyable gaming experience for individuals with such conditions. The goal is to leverage technology not just for entertainment but as a means of therapy and empowerment for those facing muscular challenges.

## What it does
Synapse-Sprinter-Crossy Road allows two players to engage in a Crossy Roads-style game, utilizing live data obtained from muscle movements to control the players within the game environment.

## How we built it
The project involved connecting an Arduino device to our laptop, capturing real-time inputs from muscle movements, and utilizing these inputs to drive the in-game actions of the players.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Setting up Arduino:** Configuring the Arduino and establishing a stable connection with our system.
- **Reading and Parsing Data:** Extracting meaningful data from muscle inputs and converting it into usable game commands.
- **Designing the Game:** Creating an engaging game interface that effectively integrates live data for player movement.

## Assembling the Hardware (Arduino BioAmp EXG Pill Package)
Our team documented the process of assembling the hardware components using the ARDUINO BioAmp EXG Pill package. Here's a glimpse of our assembly process:

### ðŸ”Œ Wiring Quick-Start

| **Arduino Uno** | **BioAmp EXG Pill** |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `A0`            | EMG-1 (Channel 1)    |
| `A1`            | EMG-2 (Channel 2)    |
| `5 V`           | `VCC`                |
| `GND`           | `GND`                |

> Plug the Pillâ€™s 3.5 mm jack into your **Ag/AgCl electrodes**, snap on two leads per muscle group, and youâ€™re live in < 2 min.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Learning New Concepts:** Mastering the process of connecting Arduino to our system, implementing multi-threading, and successfully fetching and utilizing data from external hardware sources.
